# Keycloak Realm Operator
A Kubernetes operator for managing resources in Keycloak; The project aims to enhance Keycloak's integration with Kubernetes and to consequently allow the definition of Keycloak resources in a (more) declarative way.

> ⚠️ This is a WIP project.

While there is a little bit of overlap with the [Keycloak Operator](https://www.keycloak.org/operator/installation), this project mostly focusses on different concerns and can perfectly be used in conjunction the Keycloak Operator (which is more focussed on the deployment of Keycloak _itself_).

# Current and future features
- [x] Sync client credentials from Keycloak to Kubernetes secrets (Implemented ✅)
- [x] Create and actively manage Keycloak realms from Kubernetes CRs (Implemented ✅)
- [x] Create and actively manage Keycloak clients from Kubernetes CRs (Implemented ✅)

# Installation with Helm
```sh
helm repo add rightcrowd https://rightcrowd.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install keycloak-realm-operator rightcrowd/keycloak-realm-operator
```

Example values file:

```yaml
keycloak:
  url: https://keycloak.thecakeshop.com
  username:
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: keycloak-admin-credentials
        key: username
  password:
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: keycloak-admin-credentials
        key: password
```

# Usage
## Realm
The operator can be used to create and manage Keycloak realms.
To accomplish this, the `KeycloakRealm` custom resource is used.

### Fields
#### realmId (required)
The ID of the realm

#### displayName (optional)
The display name of the realm

#### pruneRealm (optional)
Wether or not to delete the realm from Keycloak when the corresponding CR is deleted

#### claimRealm (optional)
Wether or not to take management of the realm if it were to already exist while not created by the operator

#### representation (optional)
An object matching the [RealmRepresentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs-api/22.0.5/javadocs/org/keycloak/representations/idm/RealmRepresentation.html) class, dictating the configuration of the realm

### Example

```yaml
# ./k8s/example/realm.yaml
```

## Client
The operator can be used to create and manage Keycloak clients.
To accomplish this, the `KeycloakClient` custom resource is used.

### Fields
#### realmId (required)
The ID of the realm

#### clientId (required)
The ID of the client

#### name (optional)
The name of the client

#### secret (optional)
By default, the client secret is generated by Keycloak. However, a secret can be provided from Kubernetes as well by specifying this field.

##### Direct specification
```yaml
  secret:
    value: supersecret123
```

##### Refering to a k8s secret
```yaml
  secret:
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: the-k8s-secret-we-want-to-get-the-value-from
        namespace: the-namespace-of-that-k8s-secret
        key: secretKey
```

#### pruneClient (optional)
Wether or not to delete the client from Keycloak when the corresponding CR is deleted

#### claimClient (optional)
Wether or not to take management of the client if it were to already exist while not created by the operator

#### representation (optional)
An object matching the [ClientRepresentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs-api/22.0.5/javadocs/org/keycloak/representations/idm/ClientRepresentation.html) class, dictating the configuration of the client

### Example

```yaml
# ./k8s/example/client.yaml
```

## Client credential sync
The operator can be used to sync Keycloak client credentials to Kubernetes secrets.
To accomplish this, the `KeycloakClientCredential` custom resource is used.

### Fields
#### realm (required)
#### clientId (required)
#### targetSecretName (required)
The name of the Kubernetes secret where the client credentials should be stored. The secret will be created in the same namespace as the `KeycloakClientCredential` resource.

#### targetSecretTemplate (optional)
The data of the secret can be sculpted using the optional `targetSecretTemplate` field, which accepts golang template syntax. If the `targetSecretTemplate` field is not provided, the following template will be used:
```yaml
  - key: realm
    template: {{ .realm }}
  - key: clientId
    template: {{ .clientId }}
  - key: clientSecret
    template: {{ .clientSecret }}
```

#### fallbackStrategy (optional)
The `fallbackStrategy` field can be used to control the behaviour of the operator when the client is not found in Keycloak. The following values are supported:
* `error`: The operator will fail when the client is not found in Keycloak.
* `skip`: The operator will skip the reconciliation when the client is not found in Keycloak. This is the default value.

### Example
The example below syncs the credentials for Keycloak client `that-one-client` in realm `rightcrowd-core` to Kubernetes secret `supersecret-keycloak-client-secret`.
The `KeycloakClientCredential` is to be deployed in the namespace where the related secret should be created.

```yaml
# ./k8s/example/client-credential.yaml
```

Based on this definition, the operator will fetch the credentials from Keycloak and create a  Kubernetes secret looking as follows:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: supersecret-cake-shop-credentials
  namespace: cake-shop
type: Opaque
data:
  realm: ZnVubnk=
  clientId: ZnVubnktY2xpZW50
  clientSecret: U2VlbXMgbGlrZSB5b3UncmUgd29ya2luZyBvbiBzb21lIGNvb2wgc3R1ZmYg8J+RgCBDaGVjayBvdXQgb3VyIGNhcmVlcnMgcGFnZSEgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmlnaHRjcm93ZC5jb20vY2FyZWVycw==
  connectionString: aHR0cHM6Ly9mdW5ueS1jbGllbnQ6U2VlbXMgbGlrZSB5b3UncmUgd29ya2luZyBvbiBzb21lIGNvb2wgc3R1ZmYg8J+RgCBDaGVjayBvdXQgb3VyIGNhcmVlcnMgcGFnZSEgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmlnaHRjcm93ZC5jb20vY2FyZWVyc0BmdW5ueS1zaG9wLWFwaQ==
```
